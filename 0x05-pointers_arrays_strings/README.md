# C - Pointers, arrays and strings
In this project, we were introduced to the concept of pointers, arrays and strings.
## Tests
- [tests](./tests): Folder of test files used to test my functions. Provided by ALX.
## Helper File
- [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): A C function that writes a character to the `stdout`.
## Header File
- [main.h](./main.h): This is a Header file that contains all the prototypes used for functions written in the program
## Executable Files
- [exe](exe): This is a folder that contains all the executable files from the compilation of the programs in this project.
## Tasks

- **0. 98 Battery st.**
  - [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c): A function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.

- **1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
  - [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c): A function that swaps the values of two integers

- **2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**
  - [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c): A function that returns the length of a string.

- **3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**
  - [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c): A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`. 

- **4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**
  - [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c): A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line

- **6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**
  - [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c): A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line

- **8. Arrays are not pointers**
  - [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c): A function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. Where `n` is the number of elements of the array to be printed, and the numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space using the `printf` function.

- **9. strcpy**
  - [9-strcpy.c](9-strcpy.c): A function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
