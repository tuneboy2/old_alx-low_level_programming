# C - Debugging
In this project, I learnt what debugging is and how to manually debug a code with the `printf` function, or by `rubber ducks`.
## Header File
- [main.h](./main.h): The Header file contains all prototypes of functions written for the program.
## Tasks
- **0. Multiple mains**
  - [0-main.c](./0-main.c): This file tested that if the function [`positive_or_negative()`](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.

- **1. Like, comment, subscribe**
  - [1-main.c](./1-main.c): Commenting out the part of a code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

- **2. 0 > 972?**
  - [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c): Fixed the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
