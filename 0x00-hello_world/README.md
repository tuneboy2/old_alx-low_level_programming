# **C - Hello, World**
In this project, I learnt about C language, how to compile using `gcc`,
entry points using `main` and text-printing functions.
## Tasks 
- **0. Preprocessor**

  - [0. Preprocessor](./0-processor): A Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE`through the preprocessor and save the result into another file `C`

- **1. Compiler**
  - [1. Compiler](./1-compiler): A Bash Script that compiles a `C` file saved in the bariable `$CFIlLE`but does not link, and its output should be named same as the `C` file but with the extension `.o`
     * Example: if the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.o`.
    
- **2. Assembler**
  - [2. Assembler](./2-assembler): A Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s`
    * Example: if the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`

- **3. Name**
  - [3. Name](./3-name): A Bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

- **4. Hello, puts**
  - [4. Hello, puts](./4-puts.c): A C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle,` followed by a new line, using only the function `puts`

- **5. Hello, printf**
  - [5. Hello, printf](./5-printf.c): A C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line. Using only the function `printf`
