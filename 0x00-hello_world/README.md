# **C - Hello, World**
In this project, I learnt about C language, how to compile using `gcc`,
entry points using `main` and text-printing functions.
## Tasks 
- **0. Preprocessor**
  - [0. Preprocessor](./0-processor): A Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE`through the preprocessor and save the result into another file `C`
- **1. Compiler**
