# C - argc, argv
In this project, I learnt how to use command line arguments for the main function,and also how to compile a program with an unused variable.
## Tasks
- **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
  - [0-whatsmyname.c](0-whatsmyname.c): A program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If the program is renamed, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again

- **1. Silence is argument carried out by other means**
  - [1-args.c](1-args.c): A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

- **2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter**
  - [2-args.c](2-args.c): This program prints all arguments it receives, and by only printing one argument per line, while ending with a new line.

- **3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument**
  - [3-mul.c](3-mul.c): This program multiplies two numbers and prints the result. If the program does not receive two arguments, the program prints `Error`, followed by a new line, and returna `1`.
