# C - Recursion
In this project, i learnt about recursions, and how to implement them.
## Header File
- [main.h](./main.h): This is a Header file that contains all the prototypes used for functions written in the program
## Tasks
- **0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget**
  - [0-puts_recursion.c](0-puts_recursion.c): A function that prints a string recursively, followed by a new line.

- **1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together**
  - [1-print_rev_recursion.c](1-print_rev_recursion.c): A function that prints a string in reverse recursively.

- **2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange**
  - [2-strlen_recursion.c](2-strlen_recursion.c): A function that returns the length of a string recursively.

- **3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling**
  - [3-factorial.c](3-factorial.c): A function that returns the factorial of a given number. If `n` is lower than `0`, the function should return `-1` to indicate an error

- **4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate**
  - [4-pow_recursion.c](4-pow_recursion.c): A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. If `y` is lower than `0`, the function should return `-1`
