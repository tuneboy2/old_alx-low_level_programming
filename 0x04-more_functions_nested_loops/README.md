# C - More functions, more nested loops
In this project, I learnt about nested loops, functions, prototype and how to use them. Whilst, also practicing declaration and definition of functions.
## Tests
- [tests](./tests): Folder of test files used to test my functions. Provided by ALX.
## Helper File
- [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): A C function that writes a character to the `stdout`.
## Header File
- [main.h](./main.h): This is a Header file that contains all the prototypes used for functions written in the program
## Executable Files
- [exe](exe): This is a folder that contains all the executable files from the compilation of the programs in this project.
## Tasks
- **0. isupper**
  - [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c): A function that checks for uppercase character and returns `1` if its a uppercase or `0` if otherwise.

- **1. isdigit**
  - [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c): A function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`) and returns `1` if its a digit or `0` if otherwise.

- **2. Collaboration is multiplication**
  - [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c): A function that multiplies two integers.

- **3. The numbers speak for themselves**
  - [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c): A function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9` whilst using `_putchar` only twice, followed by a new line.

- **4. I believe in numbers and signs**
  - [4-print_most_numbers.c](./4-print_most_numbers.c): A function that prints the numbers from `0` through to `9` except for `2` and `4`, followed by a new line. Whilst using `_putchar` only twice

- **5. Numbers constitute the only universal language**
  - [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c): A function that prints the numbers from `0` to `14` in ten places whilts using the `_putchar` function only three times, followed by a new line.

- **6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**
  - [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c): A function that draws a straight line in the terminal by using the `_putchar` function, and where `n` is number of lines. If `n` is `0` or less, the function should only print `\n`.

- **9. Fizz-Buzz**
  - [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c): A program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
