# Low Level Programming & Algorithm
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX-Holberton Software Engineering Program.

In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:
- [0x00. C - Hello, World](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
- [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
- [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
- [0x03. C - Debugging](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)
- [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
- [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
- [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
- [0x08. C - Recursion](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x08-recursion)
- [0x09. C - Static libraries](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x09-static_libraries)
- [0x0A. C - argc, argv](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0A-argc_argv)
