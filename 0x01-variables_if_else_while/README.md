# **C - Variables, if, else, while**
In this project, I learnt how to make use of the arithmetic, relational, logical, and boolean operators in C.  Also, I learnt how to declare and assign variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, how to make use of the `if`, `else if` and `else` statements and also the `while` loops. 
## **Tasks** 
- **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  - [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.
    * Completion of the [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rrqNDWjrCWdARnWFLPExPw)
    * Outputs the number assigned, and then prints
      * `is positive` if number is greater than 0
      * `is zero`, if the number is zero
      * `is negative`, if the number is less than 0
- **1. The last digit**
  - [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c): C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line:
    - Completion of this [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/5HWhPDsq3jq1yCRQFrLl4Q).
    - Stores a different value every time the program is run.
    - The output of the program should be:
      - The string `Last digit of`, the string `is` `n`, if the last digit of n is greater than 5: `and is greater than 5`
      - if the last digit of `n` is 0: `and is 0`
      - if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: `and is less than 6 and not 0`

- **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  - [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c):  A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line whilst using only the `putchar` function

- **3. alphABET**
  - [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c): A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. Using only the `putchar` function

- **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  - [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c): A program that prints all the letters of the alphabet in lowercase except `q` and `e`, followed by a new line, whilst using only the `putchar` function

- **5. Numbers**
  - [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c): A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

- **6. Numberz**
  - [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c): A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0` without using any variable type of `char` and only the `putchar` function, followed by a new line.

- **7. Smile in the mirror**
  - [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c): A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse using only the `putchar` function, followed by a new line.

- **8. Hexadecimal**
  - [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c):  A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase hexadecimally, and whilst using only the `putchar` function, followed by a new line.

- **9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  - [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c): A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers in ascending order. which are separated by a `,`comma and a space. Whilst using only the `putchar` function.

- **10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  - [100-print_comb3.c](./100-print_comb3.c): C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the `putcha`r function exactly five times without any variables of type `char`:
    - Numbers are separated by ,, followed by a space.
    - The two digits are different `.`
    - `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`.
    - Prints only the smallest combination of two digits.
    - Numbers are printed in ascending order.

- **11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
  - [101-print_comb4.c](./101-print_comb4.c): C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits using only the `putchar` function exactly six times without any variables of type `char`:
    - Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
    - The three digits are different.
    - `012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201` and `210` are considered the same combination of the three digits `0`, `1` and `2`.
    - Prints only the smallest combination of three digits.
    - Numbers are printed in ascending order.
