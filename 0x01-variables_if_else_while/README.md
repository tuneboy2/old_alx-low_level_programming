# **C - Variables, if, else, while**
In this project, I learnt how to make use of the arithmetic, relational, logical, and boolean operators in C.  Also, I learnt how to declare and assign variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, how to make use of the `if`, `else if` and `else` statements and also the `while` loops. 
## **Tasks** 
- **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  - [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.
    * Completion of the [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rrqNDWjrCWdARnWFLPExPw)
    * Outputs the number assigned, and then prints
      * `is positive` if number is greater than 0
      * `is zero`, if the number is zero
      * `is negative`, if the number is less than 0
- **1. The last digit**
  - [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c):
