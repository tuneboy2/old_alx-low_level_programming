# C - Functions, nested loops
in this project, I learnt about nested loops, functions, prototype and how to use them. Whilst, also practicing declaration and definition of functions.
## Tests
- [tests](./tests): Folder of test files used to test my functions. Provided by ALX.
## Helper File
- [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): A C function that writes a character to the `stdout`.
## Header File
- [main.h](./main.h): This is a Header file that contains all the prototypes used for functions written in the program
